Multiple Choice
---------------

It is also possible to embed simple questions into the text.  These
questions provide a way for the students to check themselves as they go along.  The questions also provide feedback so that you can
understand why an answer may or may not be correct.

.. mchoice:: question1_1

    What programming language does this site help you to learn?

    -   Python

        +   Yes, Python is a great language to learn, whether you are a beginner or
            an experienced programmer. The correct answer is designated by using
            a plus sign before the answer.

    -   Java

        -   Java is a good object oriented language but it has some details that make
            it hard for the beginner.

    -   C

        -   C is an imperative programming language that has been around for a long
            time, but it is not the one that we use.

    -   ML

        -   No, ML is a functional programming language.  You can use Python to write
            functional programs as well.

You can also have code blocks in multiple-choice questions, or any other reST construct.

.. mchoice:: qce_1
    :practice: T

    What does the following code print when ``x`` has been set to 187?

    .. code-block:: java

        if (x < 0)
        {
            System.out.println("x is negative");
        }
        else if (x == 0)
        {
            System.out.println("x is zero");
        }
        else
        {
            System.out.println("x is positive");
        }

    -   x is negative

        -   This will only print if x has been set to a number less than zero. Has it?

    -   x is zero

        -   This will only print if x has been set to 0.  Has it?

    -   x is positive

        +   The first condition is false and ``x`` is not equal to zero so the else
            will execute.

This next type of question allows more than one correct answer to be required.  Just mark each correct answer with a plus sign (``+``).  The feedback will tell you whether you have the
correct number as well as the feedback for each.
